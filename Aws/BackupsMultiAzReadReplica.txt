Remember amazons RDS is just a service that helps to create and manage the data base.
1.Backups are created for RDS instances automatically.Those backups are stored in S3.
2.So while you are restoring the data into the back to rds a new end point is created ...Bear that in mind.
3.Note that u have 2 ways of backing up one by using Automated backups and other by creating a snapshot of the RDS instance that will help 
you to do the backup.
4.Multi Az also means the same as the Backups ...here even the data is Backed up and in the event of failure the availability zone to which the 
data is backed up is Changed as the end point of the ec2 instsance and this is done by amazon so no need to worry.
5.Read replica is nothing but writing to only one data base but having the copy of that data in many data bases and this helps for the faster reads.
6.Read replica will be having a different end point and this can only be used for reads and not writes.
