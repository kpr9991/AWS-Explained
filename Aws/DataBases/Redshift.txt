1.Data warehousing also means the same working with database but the queries 
will be Complex in this and we have to deal with large amount of data than that of data bases.

2.We have both Amazon Aurora and Amazon redshift database engines both are being usually used for managing the data bases
 and RDS instances  can run any engine what we have selected on the database to run.

3. Ec2 instance or a web server will be communicating with the RDS instance and RDS instance will communicate with the storage
 for retrieval of the data and this storage is nothing but the database so we can perform any operations on the database.

4.S sofa performing simple queries like online transaction processing queries we have many database engines but for 
performing Complex queries like the operations that are related to the data warehousing data warehousing in the sense 
collecting data and working with the data and the data will be larger in amount so with large amount of data how the way we will work 
will be considered under data warehousing so for doing this data warehousing Corporation we have Amazon redshift and 
it is also just like dealing with database what we usually have already seen in this online transaction processing like we have
 seen many other kinds of Indians like no SQL my SQL and all so how the way this is different in the sense this will deal with larger
 applications like data warehousing this amazon's red shift.
